## Project overview:

Designed and implemented a good relational schema for given Ebay data. Transformed the data from its JSON form into SQLiteâ€™s load file format, conforming to the proposed relational schema. Created schema in an SQLite database, loaded transformed data, and tested it by running some SQL queries over it.

## Main files:

data_parser.py, load.txt, create.sql, and desgin.pdf

## Main coding language:

python 3.9

## Run Program:

1. run "sh runParser.sh" which will run data_parser.py and generate many .dat files for bulk loading

2. run "sqlite3 <db_name> < create.sql" and then "sqlite3 <db_name> < load.txt". You will get a sqlite database file named <db_name>

3. run "sqlite3 <db_name>" to open the database with tables

4. run ".read query<number>" to run the queries
