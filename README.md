This is a project from CS564 (Database Management Systems: Design and Implementation).
Project overview:
We provide you with a fairly large volume of data downloaded from the eBay web site and stored
in JSON files. JSON is a model primarily used to store semi-structured data. It has become increasingly
popular in recent years, and, for now, you can treat it as just another type of data that is straightforward to
read. In this project, you will examine the data and apply the principles of database design that we learned
in class in order to implement a good relational schema for it. You will then write a Python program to
transform the data from its JSON form into SQLiteâ€™s load file format, conforming to your relational schema.
You will create your schema in a SQLite database, load your transformed data, and test it by running some
SQL queries over it.
I (Zelong Jiang) wrote data_parser.py, runParser.sh, load.txt, and all sql queries.
My partner Junior Esparza Diaz wrote design.pdf
